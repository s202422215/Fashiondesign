      <h2>Fashion design</h2>
      <p>Fashion design is the art of applying design, aesthetics, clothing construction, 
        and natural beauty to clothing and its accessories. It is influenced by diverse 
        cultures and different trends and has varied over time and place. "A fashion designer 
        creates clothing, including dresses, suits, pants, and skirts, and accessories like 
        shoes and handbags, for consumers. They can specialize in clothing, accessory, or 
        jewelry design, or may work in more than one of these areas.</p>

          <h2>Fashion designers </h2>
          <p>Fashion designers work in a variety of ways when designing their pieces and 
            accessories such as rings, bracelets, necklaces, earrings and clothes. Due to 
            the time required to put a garment out on the market, designers must anticipate 
            changes to consumer desires. Fashion designers are responsible for creating looks 
            for individual garments, involving shape, color, fabric, trimming, and more.
            Fashion designers attempt to design clothes that are functional as well as
            aesthetically pleasing. They consider who is likely to wear a garment and the 
            situations in which it will be worn, and they work with a wide range of materials, 
            colors, patterns, and styles. Though most clothing worn for everyday wear falls within 
            a narrow range of conventional styles, unusual garments are usually sought for special 
            occasions such as evening wear or party dresses.
            Some clothes are made specifically for an individual, as in the case of haute couture 
            or bespoke tailoring.</p>

          <h2>Garment design</h2>
          <p>Garment design includes components of "color, texture, space, lines, pattern, silhouette, 
            shape, proportion, balance, emphasis, rhythm, and harmony". All of these elements come 
            together to design a garment by creating visual interest for consumers.Fashion designers work 
            in various ways, some start with a vision in their head and later move into drawing it on 
            paper or on a computer, while others go directly into draping fabric onto a dress form, 
            also known as a mannequin. The design process is unique to the designer and it is rather 
            intriguing to see the various steps that go into the process. Designing a garment starts 
            with patternmaking. The process begins with creating a sloper or base pattern. The sloper
            will fit the size of the model a designer is working with or a base can be made by utilizing 
            standard size charting.Three major manipulations within patternmaking include dart manipulation, 
            contouring, and added fullness. Dart manipulation allows for a dart to be moved on a garment 
            in various places but does not change the overall fit of the garment. Contouring allows for areas 
            of a garment to fit closer to areas of the torso such as the bust or shoulders. Added fullness 
            increases the length or width of a pattern to change the frame as well as fit of the garment. 
            The fullness can be added on one side, unequal, or equally to the pattern.</p>
